					<h2>What to Expect</h2>
						<p>The classes consist of a wide variety of exercises, from bodyweight routines to weight training. Each workout is different, and customized for the participants. </p>
						<p>We have all kinds of fun stuff for workout stations. We have tires that need to be flipped, sledgehammers that need to be thrown, and a few other fun things (Did someone say sled?).</p>
						<p>You're going to work out for the full 50 minutes. You're going to be breathing hard at the end. You might want to call your mommy. Some people call it hard. We call it progress. </p>
						<p>We also log your progress. As long as you're coming to class, we will be keeping tabs on how you're doing. This is going to help us modify our workouts to best suit you. After all, fitness classes can't be a one-size-fits-all solution. </p>
						<p>Whether you're just starting to work out, or you're a seasoned gym rat, don't worry. Class is for anyone who wants to live the fitness lifestyle. So, no matter what your starting point, you can still enjoy yourself and make progress.</p>
